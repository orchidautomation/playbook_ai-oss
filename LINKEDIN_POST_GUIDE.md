## Hashtag Strategy

**Primary (Always Use):**
#AIWorkflows #SalesIntelligence #B2BSales #Python #BuildInPublic

**Secondary (Pick 3-5):**
#SalesEnablement #GTM #GoToMarket #RevenueOps #SalesOps #AIAgents #LLM #OpenAI #SalesTech #MarTech

**Trending (Check Before Posting):**
#AIAutomation #GenerativeAI #LLMApplications #AgenticAI #SalesAutomation

**Don't Overdo It:**
- Max 10 hashtags
- Place at end of post, not inline
- Focus on relevance over quantity

---

## Posting Time Optimization

**Best Times (US Eastern):**
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM:** Peak B2B engagement
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 1-2 PM:** Lunch break scrolling
- **Saturday 8-10 AM:** Weekend warriors, high engagement for builders

**Avoid:**
- Monday mornings (inbox overload)
- Friday afternoons (checked out)
- Late evenings (poor algorithm boost)

**Pro Tip:** Post on Saturday morning to align with your build story. Shows authenticity.

## Engagement Playbook

**First Hour is Critical:**
LinkedIn algorithm heavily weights early engagement.

**Your job:**
1. Respond to EVERY comment within 5 minutes
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Tag relevant people
4. Share additional insights
5. Create mini-threads in comments

**Sample Responses:**

Comment: "This is amazing! How did you learn Agno Workflows?"
You: "Thanks! Agno's docs are excellent. The key insight was treating agents as composable units. Happy to share my learning path - DM me!"

Comment: "Seems like you're undermining OctaveHQ's business"
You: "Actually the opposite! I did this to understand their insight: static playbooks are dead. The moat isn't the code - it's their GTM, brand, and customer relationships. I can rebuild the pipeline; I can't rebuild their distribution."

Comment: "Would love to see the code"
You: "Working on cleaning it up for a technical deep-dive post. Follow me for updates!"

---

## Controversy Management

**You WILL get these comments:**

**1. "Why would you give away their IP?"**
Response: "This is publicly available functionality. The real value is in their go-to-market, customer relationships, and brand. I can rebuild the code; I can't rebuild their distribution. That's where startups win."

**2. "10 hours? Seems exaggerated"**
Response: "Commit timestamps don't lie. The key was using Agno Workflows for orchestration and Firecrawl for scraping - standing on giants' shoulders. Could you do it in 10 hours first try? Probably not. But that's the point of building in public - sharing what's possible."

**3. "This isn't production-ready"**
Response: "Define production-ready. It generates sequencer-compatible emails, has 100% scraping success rate, and processes playbooks in 3 minutes. What specific production requirements does it miss?"

**4. "You're just a wrapper around GPT"**
Response: "100%. But so is most of AI right now. The innovation is in the architecture: 15 specialized agents, 6 parallel execution blocks, structured output with Pydantic. The LLM is a commodity; the workflow is the differentiation."

**Turn Controversy Into Engagement:**
- Don't delete negative comments (looks bad)
- Respond thoughtfully and quickly
- Use it to clarify your position
- Keep it professional, never defensive

## My Recommendation

**Start with STORY version on Saturday morning.**

Why?
- Authentic timing (matches your build weekend)
- More human and relatable than viral
- Shows depth beyond just flexing
- Builds real connections
- Less likely to come across as bragging

**Then follow up with:**
- Monday: Engage with all comments
- Thursday: Technical deep-dive (short version)
- Next Tuesday: Lessons learned
- Next week: Viral version repositioned as "The story went viral, here's the TL;DR"

This strategy:
- Establishes authenticity first
- Provides value before asking for engagement
- Creates a content series
- Builds sustained interest vs one-hit wonder
- Positions you as thoughtful builder, not just hype machine
