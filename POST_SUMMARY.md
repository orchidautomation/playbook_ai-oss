### Week 2: Thursday
**Post:** `linkedin_post_short.md` (Technical version)
**Why:** Establish credibility with technical audience

**CTA:** "Building AI workflows? Let's connect."

### Week 3+: Optional Viral Boost

**CTA:** "Drop two URLs and I'll generate a playbook (first 5)"

## Key Insights to Emphasize

2. **Create 1-2 visual assets** (architecture diagram + results screenshot)
3. **Pick your posting time** (Saturday 8-10 AM for Story version)
