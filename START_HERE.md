**Week 3 (Optional): VIRAL**

## ⚠️ If You're Still Overthinking

### Just do this:

1. Open `linkedin_post_story.md`
2. Copy it
3. Paste into LinkedIn
4. Click "Post"
5. Done

**You can iterate later. Ship now.**

---

## 💬 First 3 Hours After Posting

**This is critical. LinkedIn algorithm weights early engagement heavily.**

Your job:
1. ✅ Respond to EVERY comment within 5 minutes
2. ✅ Ask follow-up questions
3. ✅ Share additional insights
4. ✅ Create mini-threads
5. ✅ Be genuine and helpful

**Block your calendar. This is work.**

---

## 📱 Mobile Checklist

Before posting, check on your phone:

```
[ ] Text is readable
[ ] Paragraphs aren't too long
[ ] Line breaks look good
[ ] Image displays correctly
[ ] Links work (if any)
[ ] Hashtags aren't overwhelming
```

**LinkedIn is mobile-first. Always check mobile preview.**

---

## 🎨 Do You Need a Visual?

**Short answer: It helps, but not required.**

**With visual:**
- 94% more views
- 2x more comments
- 5x more engagement

**Without visual:**
- Still works
- Saves time
- Shows confidence in content

**My take:**
- If you have 30 minutes → Create architecture diagram
- If you have 5 minutes → Create metrics card in Canva
- If you have 0 minutes → Ship without visual

**Don't let visual creation delay your post.**

---

## 🔥 Power Moves

### Add a First Comment Immediately After Posting

Example:
```
A few folks asked about the tech stack:

• Agno Workflows 2.0: Orchestration + parallel execution
• Firecrawl SDK: Web scraping (5,000 URL mapping)
• OpenAI GPT-4o: All 15 specialist agents
• Python + Pydantic: Type safety throughout

The key insight: Specialized agents in parallel >> generalist
agents sequentially

Happy to answer technical questions!
```

**Why:**
- Adds context without cluttering main post
- Primes engagement (people more likely to comment)
- Shows you're active and responsive

---

- 2,000-8,000 impressions (story version)
- 80-200 reactions

### Real Metrics (Business Value)
