# LinkedIn Post: 10-Hour Weekend Build (Short Version)

---

I just cloned OctaveHQ in a weekend.

10 hours. 5,000 lines of code. One insane sales intelligence pipeline.

**What it does:**
Drop in two URLs (vendor + prospect) → 3 minutes later → Production-ready sales playbook

Not a document. Actual sequencer-ready emails. Call scripts. Battle cards. Objection handling. Competitive positioning.

**The pipeline:**

Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering
→ Scrapes and analyzes both companies
→ Maps 5,000+ URLs, selects 10-15 best pages
→ Batch scrapes everything in one job

Phase 2: Vendor Extraction (8 parallel AI agents)
→ Offerings, case studies, proof points, value props, customers, use cases, personas, differentiators
→ 45+ GTM elements extracted per vendor

Phase 3: Prospect Intelligence
→ Identifies pain points and company context
→ Maps to 3-5 buyer personas with priority scores
→ Answers: "Who do I call and why do they care?"

Phase 4: Playbook Generation (3 parallel specialists)
→ 12 emails (4-touch sequences × 3 personas)
→ Call scripts with pattern interrupts
→ Battle cards with exact talk tracks

**The results:**
- Manual playbook creation: 16-24 hours
- Automated: 3 minutes
- That's 480-960x faster
- Cost: $0.15-0.30 per playbook
- 100% web scraping success rate

**The stack:**
- Agno Workflows 2.0 (orchestration)
- Firecrawl SDK (scraping)
- GPT-4o (15 specialist agents)
- Python + Pydantic (type safety)

**Key architecture decision:**
Parallel execution everywhere. 8 vendor extractors run simultaneously. Same pattern across 6 workflow stages. That's where the speed comes from.

**What I learned:**

1. Firecrawl is underrated. Can map 5,000+ URLs per domain. Once you figure out the SDK quirks, it's bulletproof.

2. Specialized AI agents beat generalists. Each agent has ONE job. The Buyer Persona Analyst synthesizes everything to answer: "Who cares and why?"

3. Production-ready means integration-ready. Email sequences match Lemlist/Smartlead field requirements. Battle cards format for CRM knowledge bases. No post-processing.

**Why this matters:**

Sales teams spend weeks creating playbooks that go stale in months.

This system does it in 3 minutes. And you can regenerate it tomorrow when the market shifts.

That's the real insight behind OctaveHQ - static playbooks are dead. Context needs to be real-time.

I just proved you can build the core pipeline in a weekend.

**The breakdown:**
- Hour 1-2: Research + architecture
- Hour 3-4: Intelligence gathering
- Hour 5-6: Vendor extraction
- Hour 7-8: Prospect analysis
- Hour 9-10: Playbook generation

Clean commits. Clear phases. Production-ready code.

AI workflows are the new microservices.

Small, focused agents composed into powerful pipelines.

The future of GTM isn't more automation of bad process.

It's using AI to do the research and personalization humans should've been doing all along - but at scale.

## Alternative Hook Options:

**Option 1 (Technical):**
I spent 10 hours this weekend cloning a $10M+ sales intelligence platform.

**Option 2 (Business Value):**
Sales playbooks take 16-24 hours to create manually. I just automated it to 3 minutes.

**Option 3 (Bold Claim):**
OctaveHQ built something incredible. I rebuilt the core in 10 hours.

**Option 4 (Problem-First):**
Sales teams waste weeks creating playbooks that go stale in months. I built a system that does it in 3 minutes.

**Option 5 (Humble Brag):**
I cloned OctaveHQ in a weekend. Here's what I learned about AI workflow architecture.

**Option 6 (Results-First):**
480x faster. 100% success rate. $0.30 per playbook. Here's how I built it.
