As a contributor to the research, as well as being a proud provider and customer of HockeyStack, the measurable impact of gifting is a topic that is very close to our hearts.\n\nIn this article, we wanted to spotlight some of the insights from that report, as well as adding some of our own internal customer data, to build on what the HockeyStack team have put together in their report.\n\n**Join me August 9th** as I dive into this new data on \" [The True ROI\u00a0of Gifting](http://www.sendoso.com/resources/webinars/new-data-whats-the-true-roi-of-gifting)\" with Canberk Beker, Head of Growth at HockeyStack and Liam Moroney CEO & Co-Founder at Storybook Marketing.\n\n## Key Findings\n\nThe overarching findings in the report talked about the impact that gifting has on inbound and marketing results, but what really stood out to us was just how much that impact occurs all the way across the journey.\n\nAccording to the HockeyStack report, the data on integrating gifting into outbound sales efforts yields compelling results from the first outbound moment:\n\n- Outbound gifting boosts meeting rates +3.08x.\n- Outbound gifting increases win rates +1.84x.\n- Gifting campaigns reduce the cost of MQLs by -43%\n- Gifting campaign SQLs result in larger deals that close 29% faster.\n- In currently open deals, gifting after the first call leads to a massive improvement in second call rates +6.31x.\n\n## **Impact of Gifting on Deal Cycles**\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/66b39159334191a662f0fe25_669fd28c9bcb56205b620d7a_1.avif)\n\n### **3x Increased Meeting Rates**\n\nFrom a dataset of 390M emails, the report found that outbound emails including a gift exhibited a 3x higher meeting rate than those without them.\n\nConsidering the effort and tech that goes into increasing open rates alone, tripling the amount of meetings by incorporating a gifting strategy is truly transformative for teams. This is especially powerful as the industry is only seeing declining rates in outbound performance in recent years.\n\n### **6x Improvement in Second Call Rates**\n\nAs any sales rep knows, getting someone to take a call and see what you do is one thing, but turning that into an ongoing engagement is where the deal is make or break. Which is why it\u2019s so exciting to see the impact of gifting in strengthening that engagement.\n\nWhere gifting was included, there was a staggering 6.3x improvement in second call rates compared to those without, truly demonstrating how much a thoughtful gifting experience can build a sales relationship right from the start.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/66b39159334191a662f0fe20_669fd2a04fa8ff8af8643375_2.avif)\n\n### **1.84x Increased Win Rates**\n\nOf those outbound deals that originated with gifting, the win rate was dramatically increased too, showing a **1.84x improvement** over efforts where outbound didn\u2019t include any gifts.\n\nAs perfectly stated in the report:\n\n> _\u201cThis data shows that offering gifts actually doesn't make people have a meeting with you just for the gift, but it actually improves the close rate as well.\u201d_\n\n### **13% Bigger Deals Closing 29% Faster**\n\nDeals including gifting correlated with an impressive deal size increase of 13%, which drives up the impact even further. But they weren\u2019t just bigger deals \u2014 they also closed 29% faster than those without gifting.\n\nThis is huge news for sales leaders, because it\u2019s much easier to hit targets by increasing the sizes of deals in your pipeline than by sourcing new ones entirely.\n\nOverall, the report data painted a phenomenal picture of the impact that gifting can have. But, even for those accounts in the report, what\u2019s missing is the difference between good gifting strategy and bad, and the even more impressive gains that can come with a best-in-class approach.\n\n### **-43% MQL Cost**\n\n**\u200d** An interesting note from the HockeyStack report was that MQL:SQL conversion rates went down 9% when gifting was involved.\n\nLike all mis-targeted spray&pray marketing tactics, injudiciously \u201cgifting\u201d transactionally to buy leads may lead to a higher than average unqualified MQL rate, but that becomes insignificant when compared to other aspects of gifting (like SQLs that result in +13% larger deals that close 29% faster).\n\nCompanies like [PatientPop](https://www.sendoso.com/success-stories/patientpop) that take a more targeted approach see huge returns:\n\n- 7-Figure pipeline generated consistently each month\n- Broke demos booked record in the first month\n- 292% on YTD ROI (the most important number)\n\n## Sendoso Customer Insights\n\nThe one area that wasn\u2019t addressed in the report was a critical one: return on investment (ROI).\n\nAs the report mentioned, the sample of companies spent a meaningful amount of their budget on gifting, and any marketing leader knows how hard justifying that spend to Finance can be, especially if it hasn\u2019t been a part of the program before.\n\nSo what does this spend and return typically look like?\n\nTo answer this question, we looked across the Sendoso customer base to identify some key criteria that would add the final piece of the story. Since our platform integrates right into the CRM data, we\u2019re able\u00a0 to take those gifting campaigns all the way down to a closed/won view.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/66b39159334191a662f0fe14_669fd2d37fb8e78f39b70b20_3.avif)\n\n### Campaign Cost\n\nIn order to get a true ROI picture, we need to start with the costs that went into the campaigns. According to our data, the average total campaign budget was around $13,866, with the average individual campaign running at $6,612.\n\nThe average campaign sent 132 gifts, which means an average gift cost of about $50, and a typical opportunity would see about 3 total gifts.\n\nGifting is much less expensive than many initially believe, especially when you consider that we will easily spend $150 per lead, compared to the same amount being applied to strengthen an opportunity.\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/66b39159334191a662f0fe18_669fd39fd8e4f72c31d8be66_ROI%2520Gifting%2520vs%2520Ads.avif)\n\n### 59X Pipeline Impact\n\nOut of this campaign spend, the average Sendoso customer delivered an Influenced Pipeline of $820,906, which equates to a staggering 59x ROI, looking at pipeline to campaign spend.\n\nGoing back to the HockeyStack data, with a 13% increase in deal size, a 29% increase in time to close, and the crucial 1.84x improved win rate, this is the type of pipeline influence that has material value to the business.\n\nBut, let\u2019s go farther than just pipeline:\n\n### 15X Revenue Impact\n\nIn our data, the average closed/won pipeline influenced by gifting is $209,967, which brings the final ROI from spend to revenue to an amazing 15x.\n\nWith other channels (like Google ads shown above) seeing a [8.49x ROI](https://hockeystack.com/lab-blog-posts/google-ads-benchmarks-from-2022-to-2024), it might make sense to transfer that budget over to gifting, where [some companies see up to a 40x ROI](https://www.sendoso.com/success-stories/blend).\n\nWhen you put the whole story together, there\u2019s no question that gifting is a revenue generating effort.\n\n### 26% Win Rate\n\nWhen comparing our data on SQL:Closed-won deals, we wanted to see it side-by-side with HockeyStack's data on the same from other channels, specifically Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads.\n\nWith those two advertising channels often commanding the lion's share of marketing budgets, it was interesting to see that gifting DOUBLES the win rate of LinkedIn ads and significantly outperforms Google Ads:\n\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/66b39158334191a662f0fe0e_669fd55f1595da1871c16aed_SQL%2520win%2520rate%2520(1).avif)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn an age where there is more pressure than ever to run efficient and effective marketing programs, it\u2019s all too easy to look at programs through a very narrow view of lowest costs per leads, MQLs, and meetings.\n\nBut, as good marketers know, this efficiency pursuit often causes us to cut out the very things that can win the deal. Gifting is exactly one of those tactics.\n\nWhat can feel like an additive element to a campaign, like gifts as part of outbound, are anything extra cost. They are performance multipliers because they are relationship multipliers.\n\nAnd that impact can take place from the very first interaction in getting the meeting, and continues to deliver impact throughout the sales process - all the way to revenue.\n\nSometimes the biggest efficiencies come from what you add into your strategy, and not what you take away. So, if you\u2019re looking to increase the outputs of your efforts with gifting - [let\u2019s chat.](https://www.sendoso.com/demo-request)\n\n## Related Resources\n\n[![Don't Let Your Marketing Be Scary This Fall: Gifting Ideas to Haunt Your Best Prospects (In a Good Way)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/69050e9c2cadfbf8bbde1bea_Why%20inbox-only%20thinking%20ignores%20the%20mailbox%20advantage%20(2).png)\\\\\n\\\\\nBLOGS\\\\\n\\\\\n**Don't Let Your Marketing Be Scary This Fall: Gifting Ideas to Haunt Your Best Prospects (In a Good Way)** \\\\\n\\\\\nRead More](https://www.sendoso.com/resources/blog/dont-let-your-marketing-be-scary-this-fall-gifting-ideas-to-haunt-your-best-prospects-in-a-good-way)\n\n[![AI Fatigue is Real: How to Break Through the Automation Noise](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/68e7ed067361615621edb0ac_Why%20inbox-only%20thinking%20ignores%20the%20mailbox%20advantage%20(1).png)\\\\\n\\\\\nBLOGS\\\\\n\\\\\n**AI Fatigue is Real: How to Break Through the Automation Noise** \\\\\n\\\\\nRead More](https://www.sendoso.com/resources/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real-how-to-break-through-the-automation-noise)\n\n[![Why inbox-only thinking ignores the mailbox advantage](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/68d185cf900db54a9568866b_Why%20inbox-only%20thinking%20ignores%20the%20mailbox%20advantage.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nBLOGS\\\\\n\\\\\n**Why inbox-only thinking ignores the mailbox advantage** \\\\\n\\\\\nRead More](https://www.sendoso.com/resources/blog/why-inbox-only-thinking-ignores-the-mailbox-advantage)\n\n[![The Future of Gifting Is Here: Introducing Sendoso SmartSuite\u2122](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6540d364a9a2f12eb85377fd/68b6ce4e475a5519d6045313_SmartSuite%20Blog%20Post.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nBLOGS\\\\\n\\\\\n**The Future of Gifting Is Here: Introducing Sendoso SmartSuite\u2122** \\\\\n\\\\\nRead More](https://www.sendoso.com/resources/blog/introducing-smartsuite)\n\n## Got questions?
